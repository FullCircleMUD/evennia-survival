"""Logging shim for evennia-survival.

Every line the library emits goes to its own ``survival.log``, co-located
with Evennia's other logs under ``settings.LOG_DIR``, so debugging the
meters means reading one file rather than picking it out of the main server
log.

Lines are timestamped by Evennia, not here. ``logger.log_file`` prefixes
every line with ``<timestamp> [-] ``, in UTC, the same format the rest of
the server logs use — so a survival line and a `server.log` line can be read
against each other directly. Adding our own would stamp every line twice.

Outside an Evennia engine — tests, or any caller where Evennia is not
bootstrapped — ``survival_log`` is a silent no-op. The import is lazy and an
ImportError is swallowed; the library deliberately does not fall back to
stderr or a local file.

Internal to the library, not part of the consumer-facing API.
