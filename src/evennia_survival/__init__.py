"""evennia-survival: hunger, thirst and regeneration for Evennia characters.

The package exposes no public surface yet. Exports land here as the library
is built, resolved lazily — importing the package runs while Django is still
building its app registry, so anything touching models must not be imported
at module scope.

See docs/INDEX.md for the design wiki and docs/test-plan.md for the cases
the library commits to.
